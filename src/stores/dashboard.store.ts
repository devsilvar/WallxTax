/**
 * Dashboard event store — lightweight pub/sub for cache invalidation.
 * 
 * When a mutation happens (create sale, add expense, finalize tax), emit
 * an event via `invalidateDashboard()`. The Dashboard component subscribes
 * and refetches its bundle.
 * 
 * Why not just call a function directly? Decoupling. Sales.tsx doesn't need
 * to import Dashboard.tsx or know how the dashboard works. It just signals
 * "hey, data changed" and listeners decide what to do.
 * 
 * Pattern: Event counter. Dashboard watches the counter; when it changes,
 * it knows to refetch. This is React-friendly (works with useEffect deps)
 * and avoids the "stale closure" issues that callback-based patterns have.
